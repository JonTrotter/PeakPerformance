# Homebrew Rules

## These Rules will add, alter or replace the dnd 5e rules.

### Flanking
- Flanking rules do apply but flanking add +2 to attack rolls instead of advantage.

## Healing And Reviving characters
### Healing
- When a downed character is brought back up via a healing spell, that character will take a point of exhaustion.
- If a downed character is brought back via healing potions, they do not incur exhaustion.
- If a downed character is stabilized prior to gaining hit points from any source, they do not incur exhaustion.
- A downed character with 5 points of exhaustion cannot be healed in a way that incurs exhaustion.
### Reviving
- When a character is revived in combat, it gains two points of exhaustion to a maximum of 5.
- A character with an exhaustion of 5 or more cannot be revived in combat.

## Potions
- Consuming a healing potion takes a bonus action.
- Spending an action to consume a healing potion incurs maximum benefit.

## Counterspell
- A counterspell cannot be counterspelled.

## Advantage / Disadvantage
- Extra Advantage and Disadvantage possible upon dm discretion.

## Skill Checks
- Skill checks will incur a 50% DC penalty when re-tried. Skill checks can be retired no more than 2x. 
- Help can be given for any Check if both characters have proficiency for the skill. 
- Roll goes to character with highest modifier

## Rule of cool. 
- If something is badass enough, creative enough, and within the realm of reason, DM reserves the right to rule in favor of the player against any specific dnd rule.
