# Peak Performance

## General Description

Peak Performance is based off of the dnd 5e rule set, but has its own non-dnd mechanics as it is a homebrew campaign. 

Peak Performance aims to solve some of the issues involved with running a campaign, namely scheduling, attendance and play frequency issues associated with a long running campaign with dedicated players.

Another issue this format aims to solve is the subjective campaign length, and lack of objective goals for the players to achieve. There is actual progression and regression baked in, and the campaign will have a defined goal or winnable condition.

### How does it do this?

Peak Performance is a more like a serialized set of web shorts, where a traditional campaign is like a movie.

Players are not required to attend every session, and each session will be a large part of a short story/battle arc, effectively becoming a series of loosely coupled one shots. 

Players are provided the opportunity to change characters as much as they like, with incentives to level up a set characters.

Character death will happen. This campaign is not character driven, and is meant to allow for experimentation, and real failure. Punches will not be pulled, and rolls will not be fudged. If an encounter is marked as deadly for the group, that is part of negotiating the risk and rewards, and what missions are chosen.
    
## Setting

Peak Performance is a nexus style campaign, where there will be a singular nexus that allows for travel to many disjointed setting that may have different styles and feels. Some of these areas will be re-occurring, and others may only ever be visited once.

### Arcadia

The Nexus of Peak Performance is Arcadia, the capital city of godly beings. It is a golden utopia where mortals are employed to carry out the deeds of the gods. Arcadia is a place where exceptional individuals tip the scales in favor of the gods they choose, and are rewarded with immortality should they remain useful. Arcadia sits atop a massive mountain peak above the clouds. Where and when this mountain is, is anyone's best guess. Arcadia is a place of politics and corporate B.S. as the gods wage war no longer with direct violence, but with marketing campaigns to win over followers while diminishing the followings of their competitors. A gods power is in direct relation to the quantity and quality of their worshipers.

# Basic Rules

1. Unless a more specific rule is laid out in our rules document, 5e rules apply.
2. If an excursion happens that rewards experience or gold upon success, characters are awarded with a percentage of the reward in relation to the session attended. So if an arc takes 2 sessions and rewards 1000xp and 500gp, if you play both you get the full reward, and if you play one, you will get 1/2 the reward.
3. Players will plan together and choose what excursions to go on from a variety of options, all with known risk and reward. Excursions will be described in a manner that eludes to or details at least some of the encounter specifics to make planning fun.
3. You can join an arc/excursion at any time.
4. You can attend, or not attend any session. If your character is participating in an excursion, the party will be allowed to choose to play your character in good faith during your absence up until the end of that excursion.
5. Players will control their own guilds that will comprise of all of their playable characters. Gold and items are shareable between all members of guild.
6. All free characters start at level 3. Higher level characters may be purchased/hired.
7. The over all campaign will not be character driven, but there are incentives/rewards to playing characters well. Each character must have 2 motives/goals. When a character accomplishes a goal, or acts accordingly with a motive, they will receive a boon. An accomplished goal will be replaced with a new one.
8. A guild will have its choice of boons. These boons will apply to character creation in the form of a free feat, ASI, Improved starting equipment, extra gold, etc. The specifics will be laid out in the formal rule book.
9. The guilds will receive boons dictated by the highest level character in the guild (Guild boss)
10. If all characters in a guild die, or the guild goes bankrupt the player creates a new guild.

# Player/Game Goals
1. Have fun
2. Build a guild over time with characters of increasing strength.
3. Play around with character concepts and race/class combinations.
4. Work together to create teams well suited to the tasks at hand.

# Player Responsabilities
1. Be mindful of the other players. Make decisions that you think will maximize the fun for yourself as well as others.
1. Do not make characters that are not willing to work with a party. You can make a character that is unfriendly or socially flawed, but it is the players responsability to make sure that is not causing issues, by derailing the party or making players uncomfortable. If you choose to make a very unlikable character, be sure to talk to the other players first.
3. Be willing to accept imperfection. DMs and players make mistakes that have consequences. That's ok. Reasonable corrections may be considered or not depending on the situation in the spirit of fun and fairness.
