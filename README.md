# Peak Performance

## General Description

Peak Performance is based off of the dnd 5e ruleset, but has its own non-dnd mechanics as it is a homebrew campaign. 

Peak Performance aims to solve some of the issues involved with running a campaign, namely scheduling, attendendace and play frequency issues associated with a long running campaign with dedicated players.

Another issue this format aims to solve is the subjective campaign length, and lack of objective goals for the players to acheive. There is actual progression and regression baked in, and the campaign will have a defined goal or winnable condition.

### How does it do this?

Peak Performance is a more like a serialized set of web shorts, where a traditional campaign is like a movie.

Players are not required to attend every session, and each session will be a large part of a short story/battle arc, effectivly becomeing a series of loosly coupled one shots. 

Players are provided the opportunity to change characters as much as they like, with insentives to level up a set characters.
    
## Setting

Peak Performance is a nexus style campaign, where there will be a singular nexus that allows for travel to many disjointed setting that may have different styles and feels. Some of these areas will be re-occuring, and others may only ever be visited once.

### Arcadia

The Nexus of Peak Performance is Arcadia, the capital city of godly beings. It is a golden utopia where mortals are employed to carry out the deeds of the gods. Arcadia is a place where exceptional individuals tip the scales in favor of the gods they choose, and are rewarded with imortality should they remain useful. Arcadia sits atop a massive mountain peak above the clouds. Where and when this mountain is, is anyones best guess. Arcadia is a place of politics and corporate B.S. as the gods wage war no longer with direct violance, but with marketing campaigns to win over followers while diminishing the followings of their competitors. A gods power is in direct relation to the quantity and quality of their worshipers.
